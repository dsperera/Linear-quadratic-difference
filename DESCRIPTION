Description: This function calculates linear and quadratic fits for a given two-
  variable data set, and then calculates the difference between the fit curves at
  a specified x value. The difference is calculated as "quadratic" - "linear". This
  allows the two types of fits to be easily and conveniently compared for a given
  data set.
